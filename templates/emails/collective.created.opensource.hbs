<h1>Hey {{collective.name}} ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>To help you get up and running, weâ€™ll email you tips over the next week, then leave you to it. But youâ€™re welcome to ask us questions any time.</p>

<p>Our top advice: Get your first financial contributors now! Reach out ask your community to give you an initial boost. Share your Collective link on social media, your blog, or raise an issue.
Donâ€™t be afraid of contacting potential contributors, especially companies who already use your project.</p>
