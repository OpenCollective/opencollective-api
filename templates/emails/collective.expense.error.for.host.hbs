    Hi there! Just a note to let you know that a TransferWise payment failed for an expense submitted to
    {{collective.name}}.
  </h3>
  <h2>{{{currency transaction.netAmountInCollectiveCurrency currency=transaction.currency precision=2}}}</h2>
  <div>{{expense.description}}</div>
  <div>To: {{fromCollective.name}}</div>
  <div>
    Please, make sure you check in TransferWise what happened exactly, you might need to create this transaction
    manually and mark as paid.<br />
    If you think this error shouldn't happen again, you can also try to use our "Pay with TransferWise" button again.
