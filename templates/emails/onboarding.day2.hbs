<h1>Hey {{collective.name}} ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>Welcome! Iâ€™m PÃ­a, co-founder and core contributor of Open Collective.</p>

<p>To help you get up and running, weâ€™ll email you a few tips over the next week, then leave you to it. But youâ€™re welcome to ask us questions any time!</p>

<p>Our top advice: Get your first backers now! Reach out ask your community to give you an initial boost. Share your Collective on social media and your blog, or raise an issue. 
And donâ€™t be afraid of contacting potential sponsors, especially companies who already use your project.</p>
