Subject: Make your Expenses transparent to your community

{{> header}}

<h1>Hey {{collective.name}} ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>I noticed that you haven't filed any expenses yet. My suggestion: be open about your costs.</p> 

<p>You donâ€™t have to wait until you have funds. Go ahead and submit expenses now, to let potential backers know what they'll be funding. Transparency builds trust.
Some common expenses include: travel to conferences, hosting & domain name fees, printing t-shirts & stickers, food for meetups, and invoicing for time spent. 
</p>

<p>Key info:
<ul>
<li>When you submit an expense, youâ€™ll need to include an invoice or receipt</li>
<li>Expenses are paid only after theyâ€™re approved by a Core Contributor</li>
<li>The Open Source Collective pays out expenses once a week on Thursdays</li>
<li>If you donâ€™t have enough funds yet, the expense will be paid once you do</li>
<ul/>
